bugfixes:

* Airshower is always in front of all other objects (this was necessary 
  since the Shower is completely calculated on the gpu using transparency for
  tracks in the future. Thus depth testing has been disabled for the shower to
  prevent it from covering itself).
    Idea for fix: 
      * Rewrite airshower-object such, that it stores a container of individual track-objects.
      * The three different shower components should also be merged into one object
        and the information about the component should be a member of the track-object. 
      * Those track-objects can be sorted by their time e.g. with a std::map.
      * Re-enabling depth testing and always drawing early tracks first should make sure
        that late (i.e. transparent) tracks do never cover early (i.e. opaque) tracks.
      * Now, make sure that the whole shower is drawn last so that the transparent tracks
        are represented correcly

* shower front center is not calculated correctly: for some showers it does not coincide with the shower front.
  This messes up the lighting and the "follow shower front"-option.

* lighting doesn't use actual position of detectors, thus lighting is the same for every detector

* when focused on showerfront, camera rotates when zooming in

operability:

* Parse README in cli (make it a qrc-file)

* check for maximum file size (rn 1.5G em-showers chrash at compile time) for user-defined showers: use ifstream instead of GFile here

features:

* shadows

* color tanks wrt time when hit by a particle

* mountains in the background (either 3d models or some nice texture)

* as soon as primary type can be read from the config: add extra line for primary particle starting at a fixed distance away fromthe first interaction

* Show relative time conversion factor in gui (next to "Animation: 1.0x")
