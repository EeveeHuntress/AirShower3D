bugfixes:

* scale resolution according to window size

* make path for airshower data in config file indepentent of folder name

* detectors: new crown does not use changed values (f.e. radius)

operability:

* take airshower data out of qrc -> user defined path to shower files
  - check afterwards again for maximum file size (rn 1.5G em-showers chrash at compile time)

* path to airshower data, shower axis and primary type to config file 

performance:

* runtime optimization: calculate VAO once with fixed time steps and give to GPU instead
  of calculating VAO anew for every step (too much CPU!)

* read directly from CORSIKA binary instead of acsi table (or at least include binary2asci converter to repo)

features:

* shadows

* color tanks wrt time when hit by a particle

* mountains in the background (either 3d models or some nice texture)

* widget to select which shower components shall be drawn

* as soon as primary type can be read from the config: add extra line for primary particle starting at a fixed distance away fromthe first interaction

* Show relative time conversion factor in gui (next to "Animation: 1.0x")

* User should be able to customize the location of the config using a command line input like 

    airshower3d -c <path-to>/configfile.cfg
