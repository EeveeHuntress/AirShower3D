**************
Prerequisites:
**************

Required are cmake (>= version 2.8.6), QT5OpenGL 5.4.0, CXX compiler
 (e.g. g++ 7.4.0)

**************
Installation (Linux):
**************

0. install prerequisits e.g. on Ubuntu 18.04:

  sudo apt-get install cmake g++ qt5-default qttools5-dev-tools

1. download the source to e.g. ~/AirShower3D-source

2. create and enter a build directory:

  mkdir ~/AirShower3D-buid
  cd ~/AirShower3D-build

3. configure the build with cmake by providing the root path of the source
 (should contain a CMakeLists.txt). If you want to have the installation
 separated from the build directory, you can provide an optional
 install-directory which will be created upon installation (e.g.
 -DINSTALL=../Airshower-install):

  cmake [ -DINSTALL=<install-path> ] ../Airshower-source

4. Build the project. Optionally, you can specify the number of threads <N> that
 shall be used for the build (can be something like the avaliable number of CPU
 cores):

  make [ -j <N> ]

5. Install the compiled project into the specified install-directory by calling
 the install target:

  make install

 If no install-directory has been given during configuration (step 3), it
 defaults to /usr/local. Once the installation is finished, the exectuable
 'airshower3d' should be located in <install-path>/bin and a exemplary configfile
 'configfile.in' has been copied to same directory.

****
Run:
****

Just execute the binary (with the example path from above):

 <install-path>/airshower3d

to display the default airshower included in this repository.

To change the airshower data, just edit the configfile.in that is created in the
same directory as the airshower3d executable to fit your needs and run it with

 <install-path>/airshower3d -c <path-to>/configfile.in

The variable 'PathToAirshowerFiles' in configfile.in expects a directory in which 
the following files can be found:

  - track000001.em.txt (for electromagnetic shower component)
  - track000001.hd.txt (for hadronic shower component)
  - track000001.mu.txt (for muonic shower component)

The expected format is the following (ASCI-encoded, 10 columns):

  particleID energy/GeV x_start/cm y_start/cm z_start/cm tstart/s x_end/cm y_end/cm z_end/cm t_end/cm

If instead 'PathToAirshowerFiles=DEFAULT' is set, a default shower will be shown.

Note, that CORSIKA-thinned showers are currently not supported. The 11th column
of a thinned shower (the thinning-weights) can be removed by hand before feeding
the file to airshower3d. However, feeding thinned airshowers is not recommended
since no unthinning is implemented so far and thus a visualization of a thinned
airshower won't look nice..
