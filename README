**************
Prerequisites:
**************

Required are cmake (>= version 2.8.6), QT5OpenGL 5.4.0

**************
Build (Linux):
**************

1. download the source to e.g. /home/me/AirShower3D

2. create and enter a build directory 

  mkdir /home/me/AirShower3D-buid
  cd /home/me/AirShower3D-build

3. configure the build with cmake by providing the root
 path of the source (should contain a CMakeLists.txt)

 cmake ../Airshower

4. Install...

  make [-j <N>]

 where <N> is the number of threads you want make to
 use in parallel (might speed things up a bit, though
 the expression in parenthesis is optional).

****
Run:
****

Just execute the binary (with the example path from above):

 /home/me/Airshower-build/airshower3d

to display the default airshower included in this
repository.

To change the airshower data, just edit the configfile.cfg
that is created in the same directory as the airshower3d
executable to fit your needs.
The variable 'PathToAirshowerFiles' expects a directory in
which the following files can be found:

  - track000001.em.txt (for electromagnetic shower component)
  - track000001.hd.txt (for hadronic shower component)
  - track000001.mu.txt (for muonic shower component)

The expected format is the following (ASCI-encoded, 10 columns):

  particleID energy/GeV x_start/cm y_start/cm z_start/cm tstart/s x_end/cm y_en$

If instead 'PathToAirshowerFiles=DEFAULT' is set, a default
shower will be shown.

Note, that CORSIKA-thinned showers are currently not supported. The 11th column$
the thinning-weights) can be removed by hand before feeding the file to AirShow$
feeding thinned airshowers is not recommended since no unthinning is implemente$
visualization won't look nice..
