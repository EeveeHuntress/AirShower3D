Required are cmake (>= version 2.8.6), QT5OpenGL 5.4.0

**************

**************

1. download the source to e.g. /home/me/AirShower3D

2. create and enter a build directory 

  mkdir /home/me/AirShower3D-buid
  cd /home/me/AirShower3D-build

3. configure the build with cmake by providing the root
 path of the source (should contain a CMakeLists.txt)

 cmake ../Airshower

  make [-j <N>]

 where <N> is the number of threads you want make to

Just execute the binary (with the example path from above):

 /home/me/Airshower-build/airshower3d

to display the default airshower included in this
repository.

To change the airshower data, just edit the configfile.cfg
that is created in the same directory as the airshower3d
executable to fit your needs.
