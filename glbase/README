This is a collection of basic tools to work with OpenGL 4.x.

The following standard OpenGL libraries are included:

GLM	       -- http://glm.g-truc.net/
GLEW	       -- http://glew.sourceforge.net/

Additionally, the following headers describe interfaces to basic
functionality:

gltool.hpp     -- Tools to compile/link shaders, and to check for errors
geometries.hpp -- Geometry for basic objects: cube, sphere, torus, teapot, ...
geomload.hpp   -- Simple geometry loader, for .obj and .ply files
texload.hpp    -- Simple texture loader, for .png and optionally for .gta files
navigator.hpp  -- Basic mouse navigation: rotate, shift, zoom

The following libraries are included and used internally to provide the
functionality described above:

lodepng        -- http://lodev.org/lodepng/
tinyobjloader  -- https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader
ply_io	       -- originally by Greg Turk, but we use the patched version
		  from https://github.com/Eyescale/Equalizer
