Add air shower data here.

expected names are
  - track000001.em.txt (for electromagnetic shower component)
  - track000001.hd.txt (for hadronic shower component)
  - track000001.mu.txt (for muonic shower component)

The expected format is the following (ASCI-encoded, 10 columns):
 
  particleID energy/GeV x_start/cm y_start/cm z_start/cm tstart/s x_end/cm y_end/cm z_end/cm t_end/cm

Note, that CORSIKA-thinned showers are currently not supported. The 11th column (which holds
the thinning-weights) can be removed by hand before feeding the file to AirShower3D though
feeding thinned airshowers is not recommended since no unthinning is implemented hence the
visualization won't look nice..
